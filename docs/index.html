<p>We feel that we have made decent progress relative to our planned deliverables. First, we installed and learned OpenGL, which we feel
was a major hurdle in becoming familiar with the tools we would need to initialize our project. Depicted below is one step in the
tutorial: displaying a window.</p>

<br>

<p>Then, we made textures for some blocks, which would be part of our deliverables, with the ability to view it from all angles by
rotating the camera.</p>

<br>

<p>Finally, we applied the textures to blocks, for which rendering them facing the right way was a challenge, and built a plane with
said blocks.</p>

<video src="images/plane.mp4" align="middle" width="600px" type="video/mp4" controls></video>

<p>So far, things appear to look good and as intended. In other news, we are working on lighting/shading with a stationary light source, 
and detecting block collisions. We feel that for now, we should be on track to deliver what we planned, though we expect to have 
difficulties regarding the physics/handling of block collisions and destroying/placing blocks. The textures are also quite glitchy when 
moving the camera quickly, which seems like a difficult obstacle to overcome.</p>
